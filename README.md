GAMES MENU

This project consists of an .exe program that contains two simple games accessible through an initial menu. The first game is a dice simulator where you can choose the number of sides on the dice and save the results to a text file. The second game is a number guessing game where you have to guess the number that the computer is thinking of, which is a number between 1 and 10. The menu and the two games were developed in Python.

Installation
To run the program, you only need to install the .exe file. There is no need to install Python separately.

Project Details
Dice Simulator: The dice simulator allows you to choose the number of sides on the dice and roll it. The results are displayed in the program's output window, and you can also save the results to a text file by clicking the "Save Results" button.
Number Guessing Game: The number guessing game requires you to guess a number between 1 and 10. After each guess, the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts made.

Usage
Run the "GamesMenu.exe" file.
The game menu will be displayed, showing two buttons: "Guessing Game" and "Dice Simulator".
Click on the desired game button to launch that specific game.
Play the game according to its rules and follow the on-screen instructions.
You can close the game or exit the program by closing the window.
Enjoy playing the games!
